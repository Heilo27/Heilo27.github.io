# HeiloProjects Market Research Brief
**Research Date:** 2026-01-28  
**Researcher:** Iris  
**Confidence:** High

This research informs marketing page strategy for four HeiloProjects apps, identifying target audiences, competitive landscapes, differentiators, pain points, and messaging priorities.

---

## 1. PantryChef
*Recipe discovery based on pantry contents, meal planning, shopping lists*

### Target Audience

**Primary:**
- Home cooks (25-45) seeking to reduce food waste
- Budget-conscious families tracking what they own
- Meal planners who want organized grocery shopping
- Privacy-conscious users tired of data-hungry apps

**Secondary:**
- Sustainability-focused individuals reducing environmental impact
- Busy professionals looking to simplify meal decisions
- People with dietary restrictions managing ingredients

### Competitive Landscape

**Direct Competitors:**

| App | Strengths | Weaknesses | Our Advantage |
|-----|-----------|------------|---------------|
| **Cooklist** | Grocery loyalty integration, real-time inventory | Requires sharing purchase data with retailers | Complete privacy, no third-party integrations |
| **KitchenPal** | Expiry tracking, family sharing | Free version extremely limited | One-time purchase, all features unlocked |
| **Paprika 3** | One-time purchase model | Separate purchase per platform | Universal purchase (iOS/iPad/Mac) |
| **Honeydew** | Comprehensive feature set | $59.99/year subscription | Buy once, own forever |
| **BigOven Pro** | Large recipe database | $25/year subscription for basic features | No ongoing costs |
| **SideChef** | Grocery delivery integration | Requires data sharing with retailers | Works offline, no tracking |

**Market Trend:** Users are experiencing "subscription fatigue" and increasingly prefer one-time purchases. As one reviewer noted: "it's not a subscription. It's just a one-time purchase" is now high praise.

### Key Differentiators

1. **Privacy-First Architecture** — No accounts, no tracking, data stays on-device or in iCloud
2. **Offline-First Design** — Works completely offline, no internet required
3. **One-Time Purchase** — No subscriptions, no recurring fees ($59.99/year is standard)
4. **Universal App** — One purchase works on iPhone, iPad, Mac (competitors charge per platform)
5. **No Data Sharing** — Unlike Cooklist/SideChef, we don't require grocery loyalty programs or retailer integrations

### Pain Points to Address

**Subscription Fatigue:**
- "locked features behind costly monthly subscriptions" is a common complaint
- Users prefer one-time purchases but most competitors use subscription models
- Family sharing issues: "every separate Apple ID/account must pay to upgrade"

**Privacy Concerns:**
- Apps requiring grocery loyalty programs access purchase history
- Users uncomfortable with apps knowing what they buy and when
- Data sharing with third-party retailers for delivery integrations

**Usability Issues:**
- Barcode scanning glitches (wrong expiration dates, doesn't save items)
- Duplicate item creation frustrates users
- Apps crash before saving scanned pantry data
- Limited free versions (20 recipes max, 15 recipes max) are "too limited to be practical"

**Technical Frustrations:**
- Many apps require internet connection to function
- Cloud-only storage raises privacy concerns
- Platform lock-in (must repurchase for iPad, Mac)

### Messaging Priorities

**Emotional Hooks:**
1. **Guilt Relief** — "Stop throwing away food you forgot you had"
2. **Budget Control** — "See what you already own before buying more"
3. **Simplicity** — "Open your pantry, find recipes. No account required."
4. **Privacy Respect** — "Your groceries are your business. We never see what you own."

**Primary Message:**
> "Stop wasting food and money. PantryChef shows you what to cook with what you have—no account, no subscription, no tracking."

**Feature Priorities (in marketing copy order):**
1. **Privacy** — Lead with "no account, no tracking" 
2. **Pricing** — "Buy once, own forever" vs. $60/year competitors
3. **Offline** — "Works without internet" unlike cloud-dependent competitors
4. **Universal** — "iPhone, iPad, Mac—one purchase" vs. per-platform fees
5. **Functionality** — Pantry inventory, recipe discovery, meal planning, shopping lists

**Objections to Preemptively Address:**

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "I already use [competitor]" | "No subscription means you'll save $60/year, every year" |
| "Free apps exist" | "Free apps either limit recipes (15-20 max) or sell your data" |
| "What about grocery delivery?" | "We don't share your data with retailers—your privacy matters more" |
| "Does it work on all my devices?" | "Yes. One purchase, iPhone + iPad + Mac. Most competitors charge 3x." |

**Competitive Positioning:**
- **vs. Cooklist/SideChef:** "We don't need to know your grocery receipts"
- **vs. Honeydew/BigOven:** "We cost less than 2 months of their subscription"
- **vs. Paprika:** "One purchase for all devices, not three separate purchases"
- **vs. Free apps:** "No recipe limits, no data collection, no ads"

## 2. Right Rudder
*Flight training management for CFIs (Certified Flight Instructors)*

### Target Audience

**Primary:**
- Certified Flight Instructors (CFIs) managing multiple students
- Independent flight instructors outside flight schools
- CFI candidates preparing for certification
- Flight school owners seeking affordable training tools

**Secondary:**
- Student pilots tracking their own progress
- Flight schools with small instructor teams (2-5 CFIs)
- Aviation educators managing ground school and flight training

### Competitive Landscape

**Direct Competitors:**

| Tool | Strengths | Weaknesses | Our Advantage |
|------|-----------|------------|---------------|
| **ForeFlight** | Industry standard, comprehensive EFB | $120-$240/year, Apple-only, overkill for training management | Purpose-built for CFIs, no subscription |
| **Sporty's Pilot Training** | Excellent training content, AI "ChatCFI" | Subscription model, content-focused not management-focused | Training management, not just content |
| **CloudAhoy** | CFI Assistant scores maneuvers automatically | $64.99/year subscription | One-time purchase |
| **AirportSync** | Free, comprehensive scheduling | Web-based, requires internet, designed for schools not individual CFIs | Native app, offline, CFI-focused |
| **NeedleNine** | Free, tracks student progress | Web-based, school-focused, not CFI-centric | Built by pilots for CFIs |
| **Flylogs** | Smart calendar, flight/theory scheduling | Subscription model, school-oriented | Individual CFI focus |

**Market Reality:** Flight schools report "the lack of CFIs is a major drag on growth plans." CFI retention is a challenge, and tools that reduce instructor workload have real value.

### Key Differentiators

1. **Built by Pilots for Pilots** — Designed by CFIs who understand the workflow
2. **No Subscription** — $120-$240/year (ForeFlight) adds up quickly
3. **CFI-Focused** — Not flight school management software adapted for individuals
4. **Offline-First** — Works at the airport without internet (unlike web-based competitors)
5. **Universal App** — Works on iPhone (pre-flight) and iPad (in-cockpit) with one purchase
6. **Independent** — No corporate ecosystem lock-in (ForeFlight, Garmin, Sporty's)

### Pain Points to Address

**Cost Burden on CFIs:**
- ForeFlight: $120-$240/year
- CloudAhoy: $64.99/year
- Sporty's: Recurring subscription costs
- CFIs often work part-time or independently with tight margins

**Tool Complexity:**
- ForeFlight is comprehensive but "overkill" for just training management
- Flight school software (AirportSync, NeedleNine) designed for organizations, not individuals
- CFIs need student tracking, not full aircraft scheduling systems

**Access and Connectivity:**
- Web-based tools require internet (often unreliable at small airports)
- CFIs need to review student records pre-flight without connectivity
- Cloud dependency creates access issues in hangar/ramp environments

**Platform Lock-In:**
- ForeFlight only works on Apple devices
- Flight school systems tie CFIs to institutional accounts
- When CFIs leave schools, they lose access to tools and student history

### Messaging Priorities

**Emotional Hooks:**
1. **Professional Respect** — "Built by CFIs, for CFIs. We understand your workflow."
2. **Financial Relief** — "Stop paying subscriptions. Keep more of what you earn."
3. **Independence** — "Your students, your records. No school accounts required."
4. **Simplicity** — "Manage students, not software. Get back to teaching."

**Primary Message:**
> "Flight training management built by CFIs, for CFIs. Manage your students, track their progress, stay organized—no subscription, no internet required."

**Feature Priorities (in marketing copy order):**
1. **Built by Pilots** — Credibility and understanding of workflow
2. **No Subscription** — Save $120-$240/year vs. ForeFlight
3. **Offline-First** — Works at the airport without internet
4. **Student Management** — Track progress, endorsements, solo requirements
5. **Universal** — iPhone + iPad with one purchase

**Objections to Preemptively Address:**

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "I already use ForeFlight" | "Right Rudder complements ForeFlight—we focus on training management, not navigation" |
| "My flight school provides tools" | "When you leave, you lose everything. Own your student records." |
| "Free tools exist" | "Web-based tools require internet and don't work offline at the airport" |
| "What about aircraft scheduling?" | "We focus on what CFIs need: student management, not school operations" |

**Competitive Positioning:**
- **vs. ForeFlight:** "We're training management, not a $240/year digital flight bag"
- **vs. Sporty's:** "We manage students, not just deliver training content"
- **vs. CloudAhoy:** "Buy once, use forever. No $65/year subscription."
- **vs. AirportSync/NeedleNine:** "Built for individual CFIs, not flight school administrators"
- **vs. Free web tools:** "Works offline at the airport when internet is unreliable"

**Industry Context:**
CFI turnover and shortage is a known industry problem. A tool that reduces administrative burden and respects CFI independence has real retention value.

## 3. CAP Wingman
*Civil Air Patrol companion app with forms, references, training*

### Target Audience

**Primary:**
- Active Civil Air Patrol members (cadets and senior members)
- Squadron-level leaders needing quick reference materials
- Emergency Services personnel requiring offline access to procedures
- New members navigating the CAP system

**Secondary:**
- CAP instructors teaching cadets
- Mission pilots and aircrew needing quick regulatory reference
- Parents of CAP cadets tracking progress

### Competitive Landscape

**Current Solutions:**

| Solution | Strengths | Weaknesses | Our Advantage |
|----------|-----------|------------|---------------|
| **CAP eServices (web portal)** | Official, comprehensive | Requires internet, separate login system | Offline access, native app |
| **CAP AXIS LMS** | Official training platform | Web-based, must be online | Offline training materials |
| **PRMA (Pacific Region)** | Mobile-optimized website | Web-only, not a native app, limited to one region | Native iOS app, works offline |
| **CAP Cadet Promotions App** | Tracks promotion requirements | Requires internet, limited scope, cadets-only | Offline, comprehensive, all members |
| **WingX (free for CAP)** | Aviation navigation | Aviation-specific, not CAP-specific | CAP forms/refs/training focus |

**Market Reality:** There is no comprehensive, offline-capable, native CAP companion app. Members currently rely on web portals requiring internet connectivity and multiple login systems.

### Key Differentiators

1. **All References Offline** — Forms, regulations, training materials accessible without internet
2. **No CAP Affiliation** — Independent developer, not official (avoids bureaucratic update delays)
3. **Native iOS App** — Not a web wrapper or mobile-optimized site
4. **Single Login** — No juggling eServices vs. Office 365 accounts
5. **Universal** — Works on iPhone (in the field) and iPad (squadron meetings)
6. **One-Time Purchase** — No subscription for a volunteer organization tool

### Pain Points to Address

**Connectivity Dependence:**
- Official CAP resources require internet access
- Emergency Services training often happens in low-connectivity areas
- Field exercises and search missions lack reliable internet
- Cadets need promotion requirements accessible at meetings without WiFi

**System Fragmentation:**
- eServices account for some resources
- Office 365 account for others
- AXIS for learning management
- Multiple logins and systems confuse new members

**Lack of Mobile-First Design:**
- Most CAP systems are web portals, not native apps
- PRMA is a website "saved to home screen," not a true app
- Mobile experience is secondary, not primary

**Update Delays:**
- Official systems move slowly through bureaucracy
- Forms and regulations update faster than CAP IT systems
- Members need current information, not outdated references

**Volunteer Organization Economics:**
- Members shouldn't pay subscriptions for volunteer organization tools
- Free CAP tools (WingX) are aviation-specific, not CAP operations-specific

### Messaging Priorities

**Emotional Hooks:**
1. **Mission Readiness** — "Everything you need, even when there's no signal"
2. **Simplified Access** — "Stop juggling eServices, Office 365, and AXIS. One app."
3. **Volunteer Respect** — "You volunteer your time. We don't charge monthly fees."
4. **Independence** — "Not official CAP software. No bureaucratic delays."

**Primary Message:**
> "CAP Wingman puts every form, regulation, and training reference in your pocket—offline, organized, always up-to-date. Built for CAP members by someone who understands the mission."

**Feature Priorities (in marketing copy order):**
1. **Offline Access** — "All references available without internet"
2. **Comprehensive** — "Forms, regulations, training materials, promotion requirements"
3. **Independent** — "Not official CAP = faster updates, no bureaucracy"
4. **One-Time Purchase** — "Buy once. No subscription for volunteer work."
5. **Native App** — "Real iOS app, not a web portal"

**Objections to Preemptively Address:**

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "CAP provides eServices for free" | "eServices requires internet. We work offline in the field." |
| "Why not just use official apps?" | "Official systems are slow to update. We're independent and faster." |
| "Is this endorsed by CAP?" | "No—and that's the advantage. No bureaucratic approval for updates." |
| "What about PRMA?" | "PRMA is Pacific Region only and requires internet. We're national and offline." |

**Competitive Positioning:**
- **vs. eServices/AXIS:** "Works offline when you're in the field on a mission"
- **vs. PRMA:** "Real native app, not a website. Works without internet."
- **vs. CAP Cadet Promotions:** "Not just promotions—forms, refs, training for all members"
- **vs. WingX:** "CAP-specific, not general aviation. Built for your mission."

**Critical Context:**
CAP members are volunteers serving their communities. A tool that respects their time (offline access) and wallets (no subscription) aligns with the volunteer ethos.

**Regulatory Note:**
Since this is an independent app, not officially affiliated with CAP, messaging must be clear about this to avoid misrepresentation while framing it as an advantage (faster updates, no bureaucracy).

## 4. Castle of the Winds
*Classic 90s RPG dungeon crawler rebuilt for modern devices*

### Target Audience

**Primary:**
- Nostalgia gamers (35-50) who played the original on Windows 3.1
- Retro gaming enthusiasts who appreciate classic roguelikes
- Mobile gamers seeking deep gameplay without IAP/ads
- iOS gamers who remember Rick Saada's 1989-1993 classic

**Secondary:**
- Roguelike fans looking for accessible traditional dungeons
- Younger gamers curious about "what old-school RPGs were like"
- Parents introducing their kids to games from their childhood
- Dungeon crawler fans tired of predatory monetization

### Competitive Landscape

**Retro Roguelike Alternatives:**

| Game | Strengths | Weaknesses | Our Advantage |
|------|-----------|------------|---------------|
| **Pathos: NetHack Codex** | Free, deep NetHack experience | Complex, steep learning curve | More accessible, graphical, story-driven |
| **Shattered Pixel Dungeon** | Free, constantly updated, S-tier rated | Generic dungeon aesthetic | Norse mythology theme, nostalgia factor |
| **Oopsies** | Free, no ads, no tracking, offline | "Where's Waldo" style, not an RPG | Traditional dungeon RPG gameplay |
| **Mindustry** | Free, open-source, tower defense | Different genre entirely | Classic dungeon crawling |
| **Stardew Valley** | $7.99, 100+ hours, universal praise | Farm sim, not dungeon crawler | Roguelike combat, dungeon exploration |

**Premium Mobile Gaming Landscape:**
- **Apple Arcade** ($4.99/month) offers ad-free premium indies with no IAPs
- Most mobile roguelikes are **free** (Pathos, Shattered Pixel Dungeon, Mindustry)
- Premium paid roguelikes are rare; most use free-to-play models
- Retro remakes typically charge **$4.99-$7.99** one-time

**Nostalgia Market Reality:**
Castle of the Winds has passionate fans:
- "The first RPG I played that shaped my life and career"
- "I remember ordering the second half in the early 90s and sending $20 in the mail"
- "Everything for me in the 90s"
- Fan remake attempts exist but none have succeeded
- Game went public domain in 1998, freely distributed since

### Key Differentiators

1. **Faithful Remake** — Respects the 1989-1993 original, not a reimagining
2. **No IAPs** — Buy once, play forever (unlike most mobile dungeon crawlers)
3. **No Ads** — Premium gaming experience (most mobile roguelikes are ad-supported or free)
4. **One-Time Purchase** — Not free-to-play, not Apple Arcade subscription
5. **Nostalgia Factor** — For those who played on Windows 3.1
6. **Norse Mythology Theme** — Unique setting vs. generic dungeon pixel art
7. **Universal App** — Works on iPhone, iPad, Mac with one purchase

### Pain Points to Address

**Mobile Gaming Predatory Practices:**
- Free games monetize through ads, IAPs, energy systems, or data collection
- "No ads, no IAP—just adrenaline-fueled gameplay" is now a selling point
- Users seek "distraction-free fun" without monetization interruptions

**Roguelike Accessibility:**
- Traditional roguelikes (NetHack, Pathos) have steep learning curves
- Shattered Pixel Dungeon is "tough to beat" even if "easy to pick up"
- Nostalgia gamers want familiar mechanics, not complex modern systems

**Lack of Official Remake:**
- Fans have attempted remakes, but none succeeded
- Original game is public domain but only playable via emulation or browser
- No native mobile version exists despite clear demand

**Subscription Fatigue:**
- Apple Arcade requires $4.99/month ongoing
- Users prefer one-time purchases for retro games they'll replay

### Messaging Priorities

**Emotional Hooks:**
1. **Nostalgia** — "Remember your first dungeon on Windows 3.1? It's back."
2. **Respect** — "No ads. No IAPs. No subscriptions. Just the game."
3. **Authenticity** — "Faithful to Rick Saada's 1989 classic. Not a reimagining."
4. **Value** — "One price. Own it forever. Play it everywhere."

**Primary Message:**
> "The Windows 3.1 classic is back. Explore Norse dungeons, battle monsters, find legendary loot—just like 1993, but on your iPhone, iPad, and Mac. No ads. No IAPs. Just adventure."

**Feature Priorities (in marketing copy order):**
1. **Nostalgia Hook** — "Faithful remake of the 1989 Windows 3.1 classic"
2. **Premium Positioning** — "No ads, no IAPs, no subscriptions"
3. **Universal** — "iPhone, iPad, Mac—one purchase"
4. **Gameplay** — "Norse mythology, dungeon crawling, turn-based combat, deep loot"
5. **Accessibility** — "Classic roguelike, modern interface"

**Objections to Preemptively Address:**

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "Free roguelikes exist" | "Free means ads, IAPs, or data collection. We respect your time." |
| "I can play the original in a browser" | "Emulation isn't mobile-native. We're built for touchscreens." |
| "Why not just join Apple Arcade?" | "Apple Arcade is $5/month forever. We're one-time." |
| "Is this approved by Rick Saada?" | "The game is public domain (1998). We're honoring his classic." |
| "Will it be exactly like the original?" | "Faithful to the core gameplay, updated for modern touchscreens." |

**Competitive Positioning:**
- **vs. Pathos/NetHack:** "More accessible. Same roguelike depth, less learning curve."
- **vs. Shattered Pixel Dungeon:** "Norse mythology and nostalgia, not generic pixel dungeons"
- **vs. Apple Arcade:** "Buy once for $7.99, not $5/month forever"
- **vs. Browser emulation:** "Native iOS app with touch controls, not a Windows 3.1 emulator"
- **vs. Modern dungeon crawlers:** "No energy systems, no gacha, no pay-to-win"

**Cultural Context:**
Castle of the Winds was many players' first RPG. It was the "killer app" for Windows 3.1 for some users. This emotional connection is the marketing advantage—it's not just a roguelike, it's a homecoming.

**Target Price Positioning:**
- Stardew Valley ($7.99) is the benchmark for premium mobile nostalgia gaming
- Free roguelikes set expectation of $0 cost
- $4.99-$7.99 range is standard for retro remakes
- "One-time purchase" must be emphasized vs. Apple Arcade's $4.99/month

## Cross-App Strategic Insights

### Universal HeiloProjects Advantages

These differentiators apply to **all four apps** and should be consistently messaged:

1. **Buy Once, Own Forever**
   - Competitors: $25-$240/year subscriptions
   - User pain: Subscription fatigue is real and growing
   - Message: "One fair price. No recurring fees. Ever."

2. **Universal by Default**
   - Competitors: Charge separately for iPhone, iPad, Mac
   - User pain: Paprika users pay 3x for the same app
   - Message: "One purchase. iPhone, iPad, Mac. All included."

3. **Privacy First**
   - Competitors: Cooklist/SideChef share grocery data; free apps sell user data
   - User pain: Data sharing discomfort, especially for food/location/habits
   - Message: "No accounts. No tracking. Your data stays yours."

4. **Apple Native**
   - Competitors: Web-based tools, cross-platform frameworks
   - User pain: Web tools require internet; non-native feels wrong
   - Message: "Built with SwiftUI for iOS. Feels like home."

5. **Offline-First**
   - Competitors: Cloud-dependent, web-based, require connectivity
   - User pain: Airports, missions, remote areas have no reliable internet
   - Message: "Works anywhere. Internet optional."

### Market Positioning Across Portfolio

| App | Primary Competitor | Key Differentiator | Price Advantage |
|-----|-------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| **PantryChef** | Honeydew ($59.99/year) | Privacy-first, offline | Save $60/year |
| **Right Rudder** | ForeFlight ($120-$240/year) | CFI-focused, no subscription | Save $120+/year |
| **CAP Wingman** | eServices (free but online-only) | Offline access, native app | Works in the field |
| **Castle of the Winds** | Free roguelikes (ad-supported) | No ads, no IAPs, nostalgia | Premium experience |

### Messaging Theme Across Portfolio

**Consistent Tone:**
- Respectful of users' time, money, and privacy
- Built by people who understand the domain (pilots, CAP members, gamers, cooks)
- Premium quality without predatory pricing
- Apple ecosystem natives who value craftsmanship

**Avoid:**
- "Industry-leading" or "best-in-class" (prove it, don't claim it)
- Feature comparison charts (focus on values, not checkboxes)
- Attacking competitors by name (focus on what we do right)
- Overpromising ("revolutionary" or "game-changing")

**Embrace:**
- Specific value propositions ("Save $120/year")
- Domain expertise ("Built by CFIs for CFIs")
- User respect ("Your data stays yours")
- Honest limitations ("Not official CAP software—and that's okay")
