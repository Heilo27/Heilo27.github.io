## Marketing Page Enhancements

### Add: Problem Statement Section

**Headline:** The CFI's Dilemma

**Copy:**
You didn't get your CFI to fill out forms. You got it to share your passion for flight.

But between tracking student progress, generating endorsements, filling out 8710s, scheduling lessons, and invoicing, the paperwork piles up. Spreadsheets become overwhelming. Details slip through the cracks.

Right Rudder was built by a CFI who lived this. It handles the admin so you can focus on teaching.

---

### Add: How It Works Section

**Headline:** Simple Workflow

1. **Add Your Students**
   Import from your current system or add manually. Set training goals and ACS standards.

2. **Track Every Lesson**
   Record what you covered, what went well, what needs work. Check off maneuvers as students progress.

3. **Generate Everything**
   Endorsements, invoices, progress reports, FAA forms—all auto-populated from lesson records.

4. **Focus on Teaching**
   Spend less time on paperwork. More time in the cockpit and briefing room.

---

## Use Case Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Solo Endorsement**
"Between flights, you need to issue a solo endorsement. Open Right Rudder, select your student, choose the endorsement type, and it's formatted perfectly with all required elements. Export to PDF, sign on your iPad, and email to the student. Two minutes, done."

**Scenario 2: Stage Check Prep**
"Your student is approaching the stage check. Pull up their profile and see exactly which maneuvers they're proficient in and which need another session. Generate a focused lesson plan in seconds."

**Scenario 3: Checkride Recommendation**
"Your student is ready for the checkride. Generate the 8710 recommendation with one tap—all student info, training history, and endorsements auto-populated. No manual form filling. No typos."

---

## Competitive Positioning

**vs. Generic CRM/Practice Management (Acuity, Calendly + Stripe):**
"Those tools don't know what an 8710 is. Right Rudder speaks aviation."

**vs. Flight School Management Software (FlightSchedulePro, Talon):**
"Those are built for flight schools with multiple instructors and aircraft. Right Rudder is built for individual CFIs."

**vs. Spreadsheets & Paper:**
"You can track students in Excel. You can also navigate with a plotter and an E6B. There are better tools now."

**Unique Position:**
Right Rudder is the only mobile-first CFI tool built specifically for individual instructors, not flight schools or FBOs.

## Objection Handling

**Objection:** "I already have a system that works."
**Response:** "If it works, great. But does it take less time than Right Rudder's 2-minute endorsements and auto-generated invoices? Try the free trial and see."

**Objection:** "What if I stop teaching?"
**Response:** "Export all your student data anytime. You own it. And there's no monthly fee eating into your income when you're not actively instructing."

**Objection:** "I only have 2-3 students."
**Response:** "$49/year is less than one hour of ground instruction. Even with 2 students, you'll save that in time in the first month."

**Objection:** "What about data security?"
**Response:** "Your student data never leaves your devices and iCloud. We never see it, store it, or have access to it. More secure than cloud-based flight school software."

A: Right Rudder helps you generate compliant endorsements and forms, but you're still responsible for accuracy and signing. It's a tool, not a replacement for your CFI judgment.

**Q: Can I import students from [other system]?**
A: You can manually add students or import via CSV. We're working on direct integrations with popular flight school software.

A: Export all your data anytime. Student records, endorsements, billing history—it's all yours. No lock-in.

**Q: Does it integrate with ForeFlight/CloudAhoy?**
A: Not yet, but it's on the roadmap. Right now you can export student flight hours to CSV.

A: Right Rudder is designed for individual CFIs. If you're a school owner looking to equip multiple instructors, contact us about volume licensing.

**Q: Do students get access?**
