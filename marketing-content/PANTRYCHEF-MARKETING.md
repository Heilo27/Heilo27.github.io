# PantryChef Marketing Content Strategy

**Position:** The anti-waste kitchen companion for home cooks who hate throwing food away
**Primary Audience:** Home cooks aged 25-45, environmentally conscious, meal planning enthusiasts
**Key Differentiator:** Recipe discovery based on what you already own, not what you need to buy

---

## Hero Section

### Headline
**Current:** PantryChef
**Enhanced:** Turn What You Have Into What You'll Love

### Tagline
**Current:** Cook What You Have
**Keep as is** — This is perfect. Short, clear, action-oriented.

### Description
**Current:** [3 sentences, 51 words]
**Enhanced:** 
Stop throwing food away. PantryChef shows you what you can cook right now with what's already in your kitchen. Track ingredients, discover recipes that use them, and turn "what's for dinner?" into "here's what I'm making."

**Rationale:** 
- Opens with the problem (food waste)
- Highlights the unique value prop (recipes from current inventory)
- Ends with transformation (certainty instead of uncertainty)
- 40 words instead of 51 — tighter

### Call-to-Action Copy

**Primary CTA:**
- Button text: "Download Free"
- Supporting text below: "One-time purchase. No subscription."

**Secondary messaging:**
- "Join 10,000+ home cooks reducing waste" (add social proof number when available)

## Feature Highlights (Enhanced Copy)

### 1. Smart Pantry Tracking
**Headline:** Know What You Have
**Body:** Scan barcodes, snap photos, or type it in. Track expiration dates so nothing goes bad before you use it. Organize by location—pantry, fridge, freezer—and see everything at a glance.
**Benefit Statement:** Never buy duplicates. Never waste food.

**Screenshot Strategy:**

- Highlight expiration date indicators (items expiring soon in yellow/orange)

### 2. Recipe Discovery That Actually Works

**Benefit Statement:** Stop buying ingredients for one recipe. Start using what's already there.

**Screenshot Strategy:**
- Recipe results showing percentage match (e.g., "98% match - missing only salt")
- Filter interface showing dietary restrictions, meal type
- Beautiful recipe card with clear ingredients list

---

### 3. Meal Planning Made Simple

**Headline:** The Problem with Most Recipe Apps

They show you what you could make if you went shopping. But what about right now? What about the chicken in your fridge that expires tomorrow? What about using the canned tomatoes you bought three months ago?

3. **Cook & Enjoy**
   Use what you have. Waste less. Discover more.

**Placement:** After features, before values section.

## Competitive Positioning

**vs. Recipe apps (Paprika, Mela):**
"Those apps organize recipes. PantryChef tells you what you can cook *right now* with what you have."

**vs. Meal planning apps (Mealime, Prepear):**
"Those apps plan meals, then tell you what to buy. PantryChef plans meals from what you already own."

**vs. Grocery list apps (AnyList, Out of Milk):**
"Those apps track what you need. PantryChef tracks what you have, shows you what to cook with it, *then* tells you what you need."

**Unique Position:**
PantryChef is the only app that starts with your existing inventory and builds everything else—recipes, meal plans, shopping lists—from there.
