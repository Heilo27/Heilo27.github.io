## Brand Voice Guidelines

All HeiloProjects marketing follows these principles:

### Voice Attributes
- **Professional but warm** — Competent without being corporate
- **Benefit-focused** — What users gain, not what we built
- **Honest & transparent** — No hype, no overpromising
- **Privacy-first** — Emphasize user data ownership

### Language Patterns
- Use "you" and "your" (personal)
- Present tense, active voice
- Short sentences and scannable paragraphs
- Avoid superlatives ("best," "amazing," "revolutionary")

### Universal Values
Every app emphasizes:
- **Buy Once, Own Forever** — No subscriptions, no IAP
- **Universal by Default** — One purchase, all Apple devices
- **Privacy First** — User data stays with users
- **Apple Native** — Built for the platform
