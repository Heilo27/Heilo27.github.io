## Nostalgia Section (NEW — Critical for This App)

**Headline:** A Love Letter to the Original

**Copy:**
If you played Castle of the Winds on Windows 3.1 in the 90s, you remember it. The thrill of descending into procedurally generated dungeons. The tension of permadeath. The satisfaction of finding legendary loot.

This isn't a port. It's a complete rebuild that respects what made the original special:
- Procedural dungeons that feel infinite
- Norse mythology creatures and lore
- Roguelike difficulty that doesn't hold your hand
- The pure joy of discovery

But now it's on the devices you actually use. With touch controls that feel natural. With graphics that honor the original's aesthetic while embracing modern clarity. With iCloud saves so you never lose progress.

**The spirit of the original. The polish of modern games.**

**Placement:** After hero section, before features.

You are a simple peasant whose life was shattered when an evil force destroyed your home and murdered your family. With nothing left but a thirst for vengeance, you descend into the Castle of the Winds—a labyrinth of magic, monsters, and mystery.

As you explore deeper, you uncover the truth about your heritage and the dark powers that stole everything from you. Will you survive the dungeons? Will you grow strong enough to face the evil that destroyed your life?

**Only one way to find out. Descend.**

**vs. Mobile Roguelikes (Shattered Pixel Dungeon):**
"Shattered Pixel Dungeon is great. Castle of the Winds offers deeper itemization, Norse mythology theming, and native Apple platform design."

**vs. Original Castle of the Winds:**
"Same spirit. Modern devices. Touch controls. iCloud saves. No DOSBox emulator required."

**Unique Position:**
Castle of the Winds is the only faithful reimagining of the classic 90s roguelike built natively for modern Apple platforms.
