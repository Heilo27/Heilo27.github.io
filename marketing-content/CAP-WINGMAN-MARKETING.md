## Marketing Page Enhancements

### Add: Problem Statement Section

**Headline:** The CAP Member's Challenge

**Copy:**
You're at a squadron meeting. No WiFi. You need CAPR 60-1, section 3.4. Your phone's browser isn't loading. You're out of luck.

Or you're on a search sortie. Deep in the mountains. Cell service disappeared 20 miles ago. You need the mission debrief form. It's online. You can't access it.

CAP Wingman was built for these moments. Everything you need, available offline, in your pocket.

---

### Add: Use Case Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Emergency Services Mission**
"You're ground team leader on a search sortie. Cell service is nonexistent. You need to fill out a mission sortie report. Open CAP Wingman, select the form, fill it out offline, and save it to submit when you're back at base. Mission accomplished."

**Scenario 2: Squadron Meeting**
"The squadron commander asks about training requirements for mission scanner. Instead of waiting until you're home, you pull up CAPP 60-33 on your iPad, search for 'scanner qualifications,' and have the answer in seconds."

**Scenario 3: Promotion Prep**
"You're studying for your next promotion. CAP Wingman's training tracker shows exactly which modules you've completed and which are still outstanding. No more guessing."

---

## Competitive Positioning

**vs. CAP National Website/Resources:**
"The official CAP website is great. When you have internet. CAP Wingman downloads everything so you have it when you don't."

**vs. PDF Collections on Device:**
"You could save PDFs manually. But can you search across all of them? Fill out forms? Track your training progress? CAP Wingman does all of it."

**vs. Generic Document Apps (GoodReader, Documents):**
"Those apps organize files. CAP Wingman knows CAP. Forms are fillable. Regs are searchable. Training is trackable."

**Unique Position:**
CAP Wingman is the only offline-first app built specifically for CAP members' workflow and mission requirements.
