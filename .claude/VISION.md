# VISION.md

> What the boss wants this project to be.

---

## Core Purpose

The marketing website is the **public face of HeiloProjects**. It should feel premium, load instantly, and clearly communicate what each app does without overwhelming visitors.

---

## Design Philosophy

- **Dark, modern aesthetic** — Black backgrounds, green accents, clean typography
- **Speed over features** — No frameworks, no build process, just fast HTML
- **Accessibility first** — Skip links, semantic HTML, keyboard navigation
- **Mobile-ready** — Responsive design, touch-friendly

---

## Content Philosophy

- **Benefits over features** — Tell people what they can *do*, not what the app *has*
- **Honest pricing** — No tricks, no hidden costs, clear one-time prices
- **Privacy as a feature** — Emphasize that we don't collect data
